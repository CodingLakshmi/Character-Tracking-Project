				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Assumptions about their intentions or position in the text </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “My friend Bongani was a short, bald, super-buff guy. He wasn’t always that way. His whole life he’d been skinny, and then a bodybuilding magazine found its way into his hands and changed his life” (Noah 320) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Bongani was one of those people who brought out the best in everybody. He was that friend who believed in you and saw the potential in you that nobody else did, which was why so many of the township kids gravitated toward him, and why I gravitated toward him as well.” (Noah 320) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Bongani lived in Alex, but I never visited him there while we were still in school” (Noah 321) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Selling slowly evolved into hustling because Bongani saw all the angles and knew how to exploit them. Like Tom, Bongani was a hustler. But where Tom was only about the short con, Bongani had schemes: If we do this, we get that, then we can flip that for the other thing, which gives us the leverage we need to get something bigger.” (Noah 332) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Bongani would cut a deal, and then he’d come to me. “Yo, we’re going to make a deal with this guy. We’re going to loan him a hundred, and he’s going to give us back onetwenty at the end of the week.” I’d say okay. Then the guy would come back and give us 120 rand. Then we did it again. Then we did it some more. We started to double our money, then triple our money” (Noah 333) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “When Bongani first said to me, “Let’s go to the hood,” I thought we were going to sell CDs and DJ parties in the hood. It turned out that we were selling CDs and DJing parties in order to capitalize a payday-lending and pawnshop operation in the hood. Very quickly that became our core business.” (Noah 337) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Moms knew we weren’t going to break anyone’s legs if they couldn’t pay. We didn’t believe in that. Also we weren’t capable of it—let’s not forget that part. But that’s where Bongani’s brilliance came in. He always knew what a person could provide pending their failure to pay.” (Noah 340) </li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their outer world, characteristics, views, aesthetic, beliefs, etc </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> When Bongani and I graduated from high school, we couldn’t get jobs. There were no jobs for us to get. The only ways I had to make money were pirating CDs and DJ’ing parties, and now that I’d left Sandringham, the minibus drivers and corner kids in Alexandra were the single biggest market for my CDs.” (Noah 306) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “There was a low brick wall running down the middle of the road in front of Bongani’s house in Alex, and every day Bongani and I and our crew would go sit on the wall. I’d bring my CDs. We’d play music and practice dance moves. We hustled CDs all day and DJ’d parties at night. We started getting booked for gigs in other townships, other hoods.” (Noah 306) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Bongani decided we needed a dance crew to show people the steps to the songs we were playing. Because we spent our days doing nothing but listening to CDs and coming up with dance moves, our crew from the corner already knew all the songs, so they became our dancers.” (Noah 307) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “One day after school, not long before we matriculated, Bongani walked up to me on the quad. “Hey, let’s go to the hood,” he said. “The hood?” At first I had no idea what he was talking about. I knew the word “hood” from rap songs, and I knew the different townships where black people lived, but I had never used the one to describe the other.” (Noah 321) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “In Alex, because Bongani and his crew lived in East Bank, they were considered cheese boys” (Noah 327) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Bongani was the leader of his crew, the guy who got everyone together and got things moving” (Noah 328) </li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their inner world, beliefs, insecurities, pains, past experiences </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “One day Bongani came to me and said, ‘You know what would make a lot of money? Instead of copying whole albums, why don’t you put the best tracks of different albums onto one CD, because people only wanna hear the songs they like.’ That sounded like a great idea, so I started making mix CDs” (Noah 298) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Then a few weeks later Bongani came back and said, “Can you make the tracks fade into one another so the music moves from track one to track two without a break and the beat carries on? It’ll be like a DJ playing a complete set the whole night.” That sounded like a great idea, too.” (Noah 298) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “One afternoon I was in my room making a CD when Bongani came over to pick up his inventory. He saw me mixing songs on my computer. “This is insane,” he said. “Are you doing this live?” “Yeah.” “Trevor, I don’t think you understand; you’re sitting on a gold mine. ” (Noah 303) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Bongani lived in Alexandra. Where Soweto is a sprawling, government-planned ghetto, Alexandra is a tiny, dense pocket of a shantytown, leftover from the pre-apartheid days. Rows and rows of cinder-block and corrugated-iron shacks, practically stacked on top of one another. Its nickname is Gomorrah because it has the wildest parties and the worst crimes.” (Noah 304) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “But I had a massive hard drive stuffed with MP3s, which is why Bongani was excited when he saw me mixing —he saw a way to corner the market. ‘How much music do you have?’ he asked. ‘Winamp says I can play for a week.’ ‘We’ll make a fortune” (Noah 305) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Our first gig was a New Year’s Eve party the summer we graduated from Sandringham. Bongani and I took my tower, my giant monitor, and all the cables and the keyboard and the mouse. We loaded everything up in a minibus and brought it over to Alex” (Noah 305) </li>
