					<li class = "li-default"> “And hands down the best, most beautiful, most graceful dancer in the crew was Bongani’s neighbor, Hitler.” (Noah 307) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Hitler was a great friend of mine, and good Lord could that guy dance. He was mesmerizing to watch. He had a looseness and a fluidity that defied physics— imagine a jellyfish if it could walk on land. Incredibly handsome, too, tall and lithe and muscular, with beautiful, smooth skin, big teeth, and a great smile, always laughing. And all he did was dance. ” (Noah 307) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “People would start screaming, and Hitler would jump into the middle of the semicircle and the crowd would lose it. Hitler would do his thing while the guys circled around him, shouting him on. “Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler!”” (Noah 308) </li>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their outer world, characteristics, views, aesthetic, beliefs, etc </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “He’d be up in the morning, blasting house music or hip-hop, practicing moves the whole day.” (Noah 307) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “In the hood, everybody knows who the best dancer in the crew is. He’s like your status symbol. When you’re poor you don’t have cars or nice clothes, but the best dancer gets girls, so that’s the guy you want to roll with. Hitler was our guy.” (Noah 308) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “There were parties with dance competitions. Kids from every neighborhood would come and bring their best dancers. We’d always bring Hitler, and he almost always won.” (Noah 307) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “When Bongani and I put together a routine for our dance crew, there was no question who was going to be the star attraction. We built the whole set around Hitler.” (Noah 308) </li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their inner world, beliefs, insecurities, pains, past experiences </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “Hitler, although an unusual name, is not unheard-of in South Africa. Part of it has to do with the way a lot of black people pick names. Black people choose their traditional names with great care; those are the names that have deeply personal meanings” (Noah 309) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “This Hitler was so powerful that at some point black people had to go help white people fight against him—and if the white man has to stoop to ask the black man for help fighting someone, that someone must be the toughest guy of all time. So if you want your dog to be tough, you name your dog Hitler. If you want your kid to be tough, you name your kid Hitler. There’s a good chance you’ve got an uncle named Hitler. It’s just a thing.” (Noah 310) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “The name Hitler does not offend a black South African because Hitler is not the worst thing a black South African can imagine. Every country thinks their history is the most important, and that’s especially true in the West. But if black South Africans could go back in time and kill one person, Cecil Rhodes would come up before Hitler. If people in the Congo could go back in time and kill one person, Belgium’s King Leopold would come way before Hitler” (Noah 311) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Then, finally, there was Hitler, the life of the party. Hitler just wanted to dance” (Noah 328) </li>
