				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “I was a product of her search for belonging. She never felt like she belonged anywhere. She didn’t belong to her mother, didn’t belong to her father, didn’t belong with her siblings. She grew up with nothing and wanted something to call her own” (Noah 114) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “A month after we moved to Eden Park, my mother brought home two cats. Black cats. Beautiful creatures. Some woman from her work had a litter of kittens she was trying to get rid of, and my mom ended up with two. I was excited because I’d never had a pet before. My mom was excited because she loves animals. She didn’t believe in any nonsense about cats” (Noah 162) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom truly believed in him. She thought she could raise him up, help him make good on his potential, not merely as a mechanic but as the owner of his own workshop” (Noah 411) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “As headstrong and independent as my mom is, she remains the woman who gives back. She gives and gives and gives; that is her nature. She refused to be subservient to Abel at home, but she did want him to succeed as a man. If she could make their marriage a true marriage of equals, she was willing to pour herself into it completely, the same way she poured herself into her children” (Noah 411) </li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their outer world, characteristics, views, aesthetic, beliefs, etc </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “Sun’qhela is a phrase with many shades of meaning. It says “don’t undermine me,” “don’t underestimate me,” and “just try me.” It’s a command and a threat, all at once. It’s a common thing for Xhosa parents to say to their kids.” (Noah 29) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, is black. My father, Robert, is white. Swiss/German, to be precise, which Swiss/Germans invariably are. During apartheid, one of the worst crimes you could commit was having sexual relations with a person of another race.” (Noah 48) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I couldn’t walk with my mother, either; a light-skinned child with a black woman would raise too many questions. When I was a newborn, she could wrap me up and take me anywhere, but very quickly that was no longer an option.” (Noah 59). </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom was the problem child, a tomboy, stubborn, defiant. My gran had no idea how to raise her. Whatever love they had was lost in the constant fighting that went on between them.” (Noah 115) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My relationship with my mom was like the relationship between a cop and a criminal in the movies—the relentless detective and the devious mastermind she’s determined to catch. They’re bitter rivals, but, damn, they respect the hell out of each other, and somehow they even grow to like each other. Sometimes my mom would catch me, but she was usually one step behind, and she was always giving me the eye. Someday, kid. Someday I’m going to catch you and put you away for the rest of your life. Then I would give her a nod in return. Have a good evening, Officer. That was my whole childhood.” (Noah 141) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom thought everything was funny. There was no subject too dark or too painful for her to tackle with humor” (Noah 204) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “‘I know you see me as some crazy old bitch nagging at you,’ she said, ‘but you forget the reason I ride you so hard and give you so much shit is because I love you. Everything I have ever done I’ve done from a place of love. If I don’t punish you, the world will punish you even worse. The world doesn’t love you. If the police get you, the police don’t love you. When I beat you, I’m trying to save you. When they beat you, they’re trying to kill you.’” (Noah 387) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “She was just having fun with me; no son wants to talk about how hot his mom is. Because, truth be told, she was beautiful. Beautiful on the outside, beautiful on the inside. She had a self-confidence about her that I never possessed” (Noah 393) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “The women in Tzaneen had a multitude of jobs during the day. They prepared breakfast, prepared tea, prepared lunch, did the washing and the cleaning” (Noah 399) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “But my mom had been working in the city all year, too, and Patricia Noah didn’t stay in anyone’s kitchen. She was a freeroaming spirit. She insisted on walking to the village, going where the men hung out, talking to the men as equals.” (Noah 399) </li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their inner world, beliefs, insecurities, pains, past experiences </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mother is as stubborn as she is religious. Once her mind’s made up, that’s it.” (Noah 27) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mother used to tell me, ‘I chose to have you because I wanted something to love and something that would love me unconditionally in return’” (Noah 114) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom told me these things so that I’d never take for granted how we got to where we were, but none of it ever came from a place of self-pity. ‘Learn from your past and be better because of your past,” she would say, “but don’t cry about your past. Life is full of pain. Let the pain sharpen you, but don’t hold on to it. Don’t be bitter.’” (Noah 120) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> My mom was smart and had a sharp tongue, but I was quicker in an argument. She’d get flustered because she couldn’t keep up. So she started writing me letters. That way she could make her points and there could be no verbal sparring back and forth.” (Noah 144) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “One thing I respected about my mom was that she never left me in any doubt as to why I was receiving the hiding. It wasn’t rage or anger. It was discipline from a place of love. My mom was on her own with a crazy child. I destroyed pianos. I shat on floors. I would screw up, she’d beat the shit out of me and give me time to cry, and then she’d pop back into my room with a big smile and go, ‘Are you ready for dinner? We need to hurry and eat if we want to watch Rescue 911. Are you coming?’” (Noah 148) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “That was the weird and kind of amazing thing about my mom. If she agreed with me that a rule was stupid, she wouldn’t punish me for breaking it. Both she and the psychologists agreed that the school was the one with the problem, not me. Catholic school is not the place to be creative and independent.” (Noah 153-154) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom never gave me an inch. Anytime I got in trouble it was tough love, lectures, punishment, and hidings. Every time. For every infraction. You get that with a lot of black parents. They’re trying to discipline you before the system does. “I need to do this to you before the police do it to you.” Because that’s all black parents are thinking from the day you’re old enough to walk out into the street, where the law is waiting.” (Noah 360) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom hated the hood. She didn’t like my friends there. If I brought them back to the house, she didn’t even want them coming inside. ‘I don’t like those boys,’ she’d say. She didn’t hate them personally; she hated what they represented. ‘You and those boys get into so much shit,’ she’d say. ‘You must be careful who you surround yourself with because where you are can determine who you are.’” (Noah 361) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “She said the thing she hated most about the hood was that it didn’t pressure me to become better. She wanted me to hang out with my cousin at his university” (Noah 361) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “She said, “Boy, who do you think paid your bail? Hmm? Who do you think paid your lawyer? Do you think I’m an idiot? Did you think no one would tell me?”” (Noah 386) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “‘Now who’s the best-looking person in the family, eh? I hope you enjoyed your week of being the pretty one, ’cause the queen is back, baby. You spent four hours at the salon to look like that. I just took a shower.’” (Noah 393) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I can only assume that my mother broke more than a few hearts in her day, but from the time I was born, there were only two men in her life, my father and my stepfather” (Noah 393) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mother loathed every moment of being there. For Abel, a firstborn son who was bringing home his own firstborn son, this trip was a huge deal” (Noah 398) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “The whole tradition of women bowing to the men, my mom found that absurd. But she didn’t refuse to do it. She overdid it. She made a mockery of it. The other women would bow before men with this polite little curtsy. My mom would go down and cower, groveling in the dirt like she was worshipping a deity, and she’d stay down there for a long time, like a really long time, long enough to make everyone very uncomfortable.” (Noah 399-400) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “That was my mom. Don’t fight the system. Mock the system. To Abel, it looked like his wife didn’t respect him. Every other man had some docile girl from the village, and here he’d come with this modern woman, a Xhosa woman no less, a culture whose women were thought of as particularly loudmouthed and promiscuous.” (Noah 400) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Late one night we woke up to a house filled with smoke. Abel hadn’t come home by the time we’d gone to bed, and I’d fallen asleep in my mother’s room with her and Andrew, who was still a baby. I jerked awake to her shaking me and screaming. “Trevor! Trevor!” There was smoke everywhere. We thought the house was burning down.” (Noah 404) </li>
