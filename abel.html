					<li class = "li-default"> “He was more like a big brother than anything. He’d joke around with me, have fun. I didn’t know him that well, but one thing I did know about him was that he had a temper. Very charming when he wanted to be, incredibly funny, but fuck he could be mean. He’d grown up in the homelands, where you had to fight to survive. Abel was big, too, around six-foot-three, long and lean” (Noah 204) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Abel’s mother and his sisters were all traditional, stay-at-home moms, and Abel and his younger brother, who was a policeman, supported the family. They were all very kind and generous and accepted us as part of the family right away” (Noah 397) </li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their outer world, characteristics, views, aesthetic, beliefs, etc </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “Abel’s presence in the house brought with it new rules. One of the first things he did was kick Fufi and Panther out of the house” (Noah 401) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “When we first met Abel, he smoked a lot of weed. He drank, too, but it was mostly weed. Looking back, I almost miss his pothead days because the weed mellowed him out. He’d smoke, chill, watch TV, and fall asleep. I think subconsciously it was something he knew he needed to do to take the edge off his anger” (Noah 403) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “When Abel drank, his eyes would go red, bloodshot. That was the clue I learned to read. I always thought of Abel as a cobra: calm, perfectly still, then explosive. There was no ranting and raving, no clenched fists. He’d be very quiet, and then out of nowhere the violence would come. The eyes were my only clue to stay away. His eyes were everything. They were the eyes of the Devil.” (Noah 404) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “That was the turning point. When my mother started making more money and getting her independence back—that’s when we saw the dragon emerge. The drinking got worse. He grew more and more violent. It wasn’t long after coming for me in the pantry that Abel hit my mom for the second time.” (Noah 425) </li>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their inner world, beliefs, insecurities, pains, past experiences </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “When I was seven years old, my mother had been dating her new boyfriend, Abel, for a year maybe, but at that point I was too young to know who they were to each other.” (Noah 154) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “As a black person back then, if you wanted to live in the suburbs you’d have to find a white family renting out their servants’ quarters or sometimes their garage, which was what Abel had done. He lived in a neighborhood called Orange Grove in a white family’s garage, which he’d turned into a cottage type thing with a hot plate and a bed.” (Noah 155) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Abel wasn’t laughing. As I told him what the bullies had done, I could see the anger building up inside him. With Abel’s anger, there was no ranting and raving, no clenched fists. He sat there on the couch listening to me, not saying a word. Then, very calm and deliberate, he stood up. “Take me to these boys,” he said. Yes, I thought, this is it. Big brother is going to get my revenge for me” (Noah 206) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Abel was always cool with me. He wasn’t trying to be my dad, and my dad was still in my life, so I wasn’t looking for anyone to replace him. That’s mom’s cool friend is how I thought of him. He started coming out to stay with us in Eden Park.” (Noah 395) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Slowly, those things got reined in. I could feel that he was trying to rein in our independence. He even got upset about church. “You cannot be at church the whole day,” he’d say. “My wife is gone all day, and what will people say? ‘Why is his wife not around? Where is she? Who goes to church for the whole day?’ No, no, no. This brings disrespect to me.”” (Noah 401) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “He tried to stop her from spending so much time at church, and one of the most effective tools he used was to stop fixing my mother’s car” (Noah 401) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “We had to ask Abel for rides into town, and he didn’t like what they were for. It was an insult to his manhood.” (Noah 402) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “‘What? No, no. How can I take my wife and her child and drop you off there? You’re insulting me. What do I tell my friends? What do I tell my family? My wife is at another man’s house? The man who made that child with her? No, no, no.’” (Noah 402) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way…. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”” (Noah 402-403) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “A few weeks later, Abel drove over and apologized. Abel was always sincere and heartfelt with his apologies: He didn’t mean it. He knows he was wrong. He’ll never do it again. My grandmother convinced my mom that she should give Abel a second chance. Her argument was basically, “All men do it.” My grandfather, Temperance, had hit her.” (Noah 409) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Abel was an amazing mechanic, probably one of the best around at the time. He’d been to technical college, graduated first in his class. He’d had job offers from BMW and Mercedes. His business thrived on referrals. People would bring their cars from all over the city for him to fix because he could work miracles on them” (Noah 410) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom applied for a license to be able to operate a business on the property. The workshop stayed, but Abel kept running it into the ground, drinking his money. At the same time, my mother started moving up at the real-estate company she worked for, taking on more responsibilities and earning a better salary. His workshop became like a side hobby almost. He was supposed to pay for Andrew’s school fees and groceries, but he started falling behind even on that, and soon my mom was paying for everything. She paid the electricity. She paid the mortgage. He literally contributed nothing.” (Noah 425) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “If there was any doubt about Abel, the truth was right there in front of us all along, in his name. He was Abel, the good brother, the good son, a name straight out of the Bible. And he lived up to it as well. He was the firstborn, dutiful, took care of his mother, took care of his siblings. He was the pride of his family.” (Noah 394) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “But Abel was his English name. His Tsonga name was Ngisaveni. It means “Be afraid.”” (Noah 394) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Abel towered over my mother. He didn’t raise his voice, didn’t get angry. ‘Mbuyi,’ he said softly, “you don’t respect me.’ ‘Respect?! You almost burned down our house. Respect? Oh, please! Earn your respect! You want me to respect you as a man, then act like a man! Drinking your money in the streets, and where are your child’s diapers?! Respect?! Earn your respect—’” (Noah 406) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Then out of nowhere, like a clap of thunder when there were no clouds, crack!, he smacked her across the face. She ricocheted off the wall and collapsed like a ton of bricks. I’d never seen anything like it. She went down and stayed down for a good thirty seconds” (Noah 407) </li>
