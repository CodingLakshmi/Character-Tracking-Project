					<li class = "li-default"> “My father is a complete mystery. There are so many questions about his life that I still cannot even begin to answer. Where’d he grow up? Somewhere in Switzerland. Where’d he go to university? I don’t know if he did. How’d he end up in South Africa? I haven’t a clue. I’ve never met my Swiss grandparents. I don’t know their names or anything about them.” (Noah 174) </li>

					<li class = "li-default"> “I do know my dad has an older sister, but I’ve never met her, either. I know that he worked as a chef in Montreal and New York for a while before moving to South Africa in the late 1970s. I know that he worked for an industrial foodservice company and that he opened a couple of bars and restaurants here and there. That’s about it.” (Noah 174) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “After apartheid fell, my father moved from Hillbrow to Yeoville, a formerly quiet, residential neighborhood that had transformed into this vibrant melting pot of black and white and every other hue.” (Noah 178) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “One thing I do know about my dad is that he hates racism and homogeneity more than anything, and not because of any feelings of self-righteousness or moral superiority. He just never understood how white people could be racist in South Africa.” (Noah 176) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “‘Africa is full of black people,’ he would say. ‘So why would you come to Africa if you hate black people? If you hate black people so much, why did you move into their house?’ To him it was insane.” (Noah 176) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Outside of birthdays and special occasions, all we had were our Sunday afternoons. He would cook for me. He’d ask me what I wanted, and I’d always request the same meal, a German dish called Rösti, which is a pancake made out of potatoes and some sort of meat with a gravy. I’d have that and a bottle of Sprite, and for dessert a plastic container of custard with caramel on top.” (Noah 180) </li>

					<li class = "li-default"> “He’s very Swiss, clean and particular and precise. He’s the only person I know who checks into a hotel room and leaves it cleaner than when he arrived. He doesn’t like anyone waiting on him. No servants, no housekeepers. He cleans up after himself. He likes his space. He lives in his world and does his everything.” (Noah 175) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My dad lived two blocks over from Rockey, on Yeo Street, right next to this incredible park where I loved to go because kids of all races and different countries were running around and playing there. My dad’s house was simple. Nice, but nothing fancy. I feel like my dad had enough money to be comfortable and travel, but he never spent lavishly on things. He’s extremely frugal, the kind of guy who drives the same car for twenty years. My father and I lived on a schedule. I visited him every Sunday afternoon” (Noah 178) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I celebrated my birthday with my dad every year, and we spent Christmas with him as well. I loved Christmas with my dad because my dad celebrated European Christmas. European Christmas was the best Christmas ever. My dad went all out. He had Christmas lights and a Christmas tree. He had fake snow and snow globes and stockings hung by the fireplace and lots of wrapped presents from Santa Claus” (Noah 179) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “A good chunk of those afternoons would pass in silence. My dad didn’t talk much. He was caring and devoted, attentive to detail, always a card on my birthday, always my favorite food and toys when I came for a visit. But at the same time he was a closed book” (Noah 180) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Being with my dad was like watching a web series. I’d get a few minutes of information a few minutes at a time, then I’d have to wait a week for the next installment” (Noah 180) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “When I was thirteen my dad moved to Cape Town, and we lost touch” (Noah 180) </li>
