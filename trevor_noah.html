				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Assumptions about their intentions or position in the text </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “As much as I loved church, the idea of a nine-hour slog, from mixed church to white church to black church then doubling back to white church again, was just too much to contemplate. It was bad enough in a car, but taking public transport would be twice as long and twice as hard.” (Noah 27) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Once a month at least we’d drive home and the neighborhood would be on fire.” (Noah 33) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “After English, Xhosa was what we spoke around the house. When my mother was angry she’d fall back on her home language. As a naughty child, I was well versed in Xhosa threats… Living with my mom, I saw how she used language to cross boundaries, handle situations, navigate the world.” (Noah 100) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Racism exists. People are getting hurt, and just because it’s not happening to you doesn’t mean it’s not happening.” (Noah 104) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom raised me as if there were no limitations on where I could go or what I could do. When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid—not white culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered.” (Noah 131) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Also, my mom had married Abel. He was incensed by the idea of my mom being in contact with her previous love, and she decided it was safer for everyone involved not to test his anger. I went from seeing my dad every Sunday to seeing him every other Sunday, maybe once a month, whenever my mom could sneak me over, same as she’d done back in Hillbrow.” (Noah 182) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I’d found my niche. Since I belonged to no group I learned to move seamlessly between groups. I floated. I was a chameleon, still, a cultural chameleon. I learned how to blend. ” (Noah 229-230) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I was like a weed dealer, but of food. The weed guy is always welcome at the party. He’s not a part of the circle, but he’s invited into the circle temporarily because of what he can offer. That’s who I was. Always an outsider. As the outsider, you can retreat into a shell, be anonymous, be invisible” (Noah 230) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “In high school, the attention of girls was not an affliction I suffered from. I wasn’t the hot guy in class. I wasn’t even the cute guy in class. I was ugly. Puberty was not kind to me.My acne was so bad that people used to ask what was wrong with me like I’d had an allergic reaction to something” (Noah 233) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “After suffering my Valentine’s Day heartbreak at the hands of Maylene and the handsome, charming Lorenzo, I learned a valuable lesson about dating. What I learned was that cool guys get girls, and funny guys get to hang out with the cool guys with their girls. I was not a cool guy; therefore I did not have girls. I understood that formula very quickly and I knew my place. I didn’t ask girls out. I didn’t have a girlfriend. I didn’t even try.” (Noah 234) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I graduated from high school when I was seventeen, and by that point life at home had become toxic because of my stepfather. I didn’t want to be there anymore, and my mom agreed that I should move out. She helped me move to a cheap, roach-infested flat in a building down the road” (Noah 326) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “The main thing that marked Andrew’s birth for me was our first trip to meet Abel’s family during the Christmas holidays. They lived in Tzaneen, a town in Gazankulu, what had been the Tsonga homeland under apartheid. Tzaneen has a tropical climate, hot and humid. ” (Noah 397) </li>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their outer world, characteristics, views, aesthetic, beliefs, etc </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I loved white church because I didn’t have to go to the main service. My mom would go to that, and I would go to the youth side, to Sunday school. In Sunday school we got to read cool stories.” (Noah 23) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mom didn’t want my mind polluted by movies with sex and violence. So the Bible was my action movie.” (Noah 23) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “It was animal instinct, learned in a world where violence was always lurking and waiting to erupt.” (Noah 39) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Tuesday nights, the prayer meeting came to my grandmother’s house, and I was always excited, for two reasons. One, I got to clap along on the beat for the singing. And two, I loved to pray. My grandmother always told me that she loved my prayers. She believed my prayers were more powerful because I prayed in English.” (Noah 76) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “As a kid, I understood that people were different colors, but in my head white and black and brown were like types of chocolate. Dad was the white chocolate, mom was the dark chocolate, and I was the milk chocolate. But we were all just chocolate. I didn’t know any of it had anything to do with ‘race.’” (Noah 99) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “They looked shocked for a moment, and then they started laughing. ‘Oh, sorry, dude. We thought you were something else. We weren’t trying to take anything from you. We were trying to steal from white people. Have a good day, man.’” (Noah 102) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I’ll never forget that day. It was probably one of the weirdest days of my life, going to meet a person I knew and yet did not know at all. My memories of him felt just out of reach. I was trying to remember how he spoke, how he laughed, what his manner was” (Noah 183) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “He was smiling so big as he took me through it, looking at the headlines. “Trevor Noah Appearing This Saturday at the Blues Room.” “Trevor Noah Hosting New TV Show.” I felt a flood of emotions rushing through me. It was everything I could do not to start crying. It felt like this ten-year gap in my life closed right up in an instant, like only a day had passed since I’d last seen him.” (Noah 185) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I went down to spend a few days with my father, and I made it my mission: This weekend I will get to know my father. As soon as I arrived I started peppering him with questions.” (Noah 186) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Lorenzo was everything I wasn’t. He was popular. He was white. He’d upset the balance of everything by asking out the only colored girl in school. Girls loved him, and he was dumb as rocks. A nice guy, but kind of a bad boy. Girls did his homework for him; he was that guy. He was really good-looking, too. It was like when he was creating the character he traded in all his intelligence points for beauty points. I stood no chance.” (Noah 220) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “At the break, as the only mixed kid out of a thousand, I faced the same predicament I had on the playground at H. A. Jack: Where was I supposed to go? ” (Noah 226) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I was an overnight success. Fat guys were my number-one customers. They loved food, but couldn’t run. I had all these rich, fat white kids who were like, “This is fantastic! My parents spoil me, I’ve got money, and now I’ve got a way I can get food without having to work for it—and I still get my break.” I had so many customers I was turning kids away. I had a rule: I would take five orders a day, high bidders only” (Noah 229) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “That’s the hood. Someone’s always buying, someone’s always selling, and the hustle is about trying to be in the middle of that whole thing” (Noah 335) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I saw, more than anything, that relationships are not sustained by violence but by love. Love is a creative act. When you love someone you create a new world for them. My mother did that for me, and with the progress I made and the things I learned, I came back and created a new world and a new understanding for her” (Noah 418) </li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their inner world, beliefs, insecurities, pains, past experiences </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Every Sunday in my childhood meant church. We never missed church. My mother was—and still is —a deeply religious woman. Very Christian” (Noah 20) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Black church was rough, I won’t lie. No airconditioning. No lyrics up on Jumbotrons. And it lasted forever, three or four hours at least, which confused me because white church was only like an hour—in and out, thanks for coming” (Noah 24) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “The reason we went to three churches was that my mom said each church gave her something different. The first church offered jubilant praise of the Lord. The second church offered a deep analysis of the scripture, which my mom loved. The third church offered passion and catharsis; it was a place where you truly felt the presence of the Holy Spirit inside you.” (Noah 22) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations—I was born a crime.” (Noah 57) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Because I don’t know how to hit a white child,” she said. ‘A black child, I understand. A black child, you hit them and they stay black. Trevor, when you hit him he turns blue and green and yellow and red. I’ve never seen those colors before. I’m scared I’m going to break him. I don’t want to kill a white person. I’m so afraid. I’m not going to touch him.’ And she never did.” (Noah 95) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I became a chameleon. My color didn’t change, but I could change your perception of my color…. Maybe I didn’t look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you” (Noah 102) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “One thing I loved doing at the time was using a magnifying glass to burn my name into pieces of wood. You had to aim the lens and get the focus just right and then you got the flame and then you moved it slowly and you could burn shapes and letters and patterns. I was fascinated by it.” (Noah 155) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My cousin Mlungisi, to this day, cannot comprehend how I survived being as naughty as I was for as long as I did, how I withstood the number of hidings that I got. Why did I keep misbehaving? How did I never learn my lesson?” (Noah 158) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Fufi was the love of my life. Beautiful but stupid. I raised her. I potty-trained her. She slept in my bed. A dog is a great thing for a kid to have. It’s like a bicycle but with emotions… I jumped onto my bike and raced home, tears running down my face. I loved Fufi so much. To see her with another boy, acting like she didn’t know me, after I raised her, after all the nights we spent together. I was heartbroken.” (Noah 165, 168) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “‘Why are you crying?!’ ‘Because Fufi loves another boy.’ ‘So? Why would that hurt you? It didn’t cost you anything. Fufi’s here. She still loves you. She’s still your dog. So get over it.’” (Noah 170) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Fufi was my first heartbreak. No one has ever betrayed me more than Fufi. It was a valuable lesson to me. The hard thing was understanding that Fufi wasn’t cheating on me with another boy.” (Noah 170) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “While I was eating he got up and went and picked up this book, an oversized photo album, and brought it back to the table. “I’ve been following you,” he said, and he opened it up. It was a scrapbook of everything I had ever done, every time my name was mentioned in a newspaper, everything from magazine covers to the tiniest club listings, from the beginning of my career all the way through to that week.” (Noah 184-185) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “The whole time he said not one word about himself. Then, as I was packing up to leave, he walked over to me and sat down. ‘So,’ he said, “in the time we’ve spent together, what would you say you’ve learned about your dad?’ ‘Nothing. All I know is that you’re extremely secretive.’ ‘You see? You’re getting to know me already.’” (Noah 187) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I liked Maylene as much as I liked anyone, I suppose. Mostly I think I liked the idea of being liked. I decided I’d ask her to be my valentine, but I had no idea how to do it” (Noah 217) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “The week before Valentine’s, Maylene and I were walking home together, and I was trying to get up the courage to ask her. I was so nervous” (Noah 218) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I spent the whole week thinking about Maylene, wanting to make her Valentine’s Day as memorable as I could. I saved up my pocket money and bought her flowers and a teddy bear and a card. I wrote a poem with her name in the card, which was hard because there aren’t many good words that rhyme with Maylene” (Noah 219) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “That’s when I learned: time is money. I realized people would pay me to buy their food because I was willing to run for it. I started telling everyone at assembly, “Place your orders. Give me a list of what you want, give me a percentage of what you’re going to spend, and I’ll buy your food for you.” (Noah 229) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “For me it was humor. I learned that even though I didn’t belong to one group, I could be a part of any group that was laughing. I’d drop in, pass out the snacks, tell a few jokes. I’d perform for them. I’d catch a bit of their conversation, learn more about their group, and then leave. I never overstayed my welcome. I wasn’t popular, but I wasn’t an outcast. I was everywhere with everybody, and at the same time I was all by myself.” (Noah 230) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Outwardly, I had carefully cultivated my status as the funny, non-threatening guy, but secretly I had the hugest crush on Zaheera… She was so pretty and so funny. We’d hang out and have great conversations. I thought about her constantly, but for the life of me, I never considered myself worthy of dating her. I told myself, I’m going to have a crush on her forever, and that’s all that’s ever going to happen.” (Noah 237) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “With the money I made selling CDs and videogames, I was able to save up and add new components and more memory to my own computer” (Noah 296) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I worked as a middleman for Bolo and Andrew for a year. Then Bolo left school…. The day Andrew gave it to me, he changed my life. Thanks to him, I now controlled production, sales, distribution—I had everything I needed to lock down the bootleg business.” (Noah 296) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I was a natural capitalist. I loved selling stuff, and I was selling something that everybody wanted and nobody else could provide… I had an instinct for business, but at the time I knew nothing about music, which was odd for someone running a music-pirating business.” (Noah 297) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “That’s when I got two middlemen of my own, my friend Tom, who went to Northview, and my friend Bongani, who lived in Alex.” (Noah 297) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I grew up in a world of violence, but I myself was never violent at all. Yes, I played pranks and set fires and broke windows, but I never attacked people. I never hit anyone. I was never angry. I just didn’t see myself that way” (Noah 418) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “My mother had exposed me to a different world than the one she grew up in. She bought me the books she never got to read. She took me to the schools that she never got to go to. I immersed myself in those worlds and I came back looking at the world a different way. I saw that not all families are violent.” (Noah 418) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “In all the times I received beatings from my mom, I was never scared of her. I didn’t like it, certainly. When she said, “I hit you out of love,” I didn’t necessarily agree with her thinking. But I understood that it was discipline and it was being done for a purpose. The first time Abel hit me I felt something I had never felt before. I felt terror” (Noah 419) </li>
