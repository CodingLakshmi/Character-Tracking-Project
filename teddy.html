					<li class = "li-default"> “At Sandringham, I got to know this one kid, Teddy. Funny guy, charming as hell. My mom used to call him Bugs Bunny; he had a cheeky smile with two big teeth that stuck out the front of his mouth. Teddy and I got along like a house on fire, one of those friends where you start hanging out and from that day forward you’re never apart.” (Noah 246) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “With Teddy, I’d finally met someone who made me feel normal. I was the terror in my family. He was the terror in his family. When you put us together it was mayhem.” (Noah 246) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Teddy’s mom worked as a domestic for a family in Linksfield, a wealthy suburb near school. Linksfield was a long walk from my house, nearly forty minutes, but still doable” (Noah 247) </li>

					<li class = "li-default"> “Walking past this shop, Teddy and I realized that if we put our arms through the trellis we could reach this rack of chocolates just inside. And these weren’t just any chocolates—they were alcohol-filled chocolates. I loved alcohol. Loved loved loved it. My whole life I’d steal sips of grown-ups’ drinks whenever I could.” (Noah 248) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I brought my hand out with a bunch of chocolates in it. It was almost like a movie. I saw him. He saw me. His eyes went wide. I tried to walk away, acting natural. Then he shouted out, “Hey! Stop!” And the chase was on. We bolted, heading for the doors. I knew if a guard cut us off at the exit we’d be trapped, so we were hauling ass as fast as we could. We cleared the exit. The second we hit the parking lot, mall cops were coming at us from every direction, a dozen of them at least. I was running with my head down.” (Noah 249) </li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class = "h2-default"> <b> <u> Their inner world, beliefs, insecurities, pains, past experiences </u> </b> </h2>
				<ol class = "list-default">
					<li class = "li-default"> “He didn’t. I turned and ran into the dead end. Teddy broke the other way. Half the mall cops followed him, half followed me. I got to the fence and knew exactly how to squirm through. Head, then shoulder, one leg, then twist, then the other leg—done. I was through. The guards hit the fence behind me and couldn’t follow. I ran across the field to a fence on the far side, popped through there, and then I was right on the road, three blocks from my house. I slipped my hands into my pockets and casually walked home, another harmless pedestrian out for a stroll.” (Noah 250-251) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Once I got back to my house I waited for Teddy. He didn’t show up. I waited thirty minutes, forty minutes, an hour. No Teddy.” (Noah 251) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I ran to Teddy’s house in Linksfield. No Teddy. Monday morning I went to school. Still no Teddy…. Now I was worried. After school, I went home and checked at my house again, nothing. Teddy’s house again, nothing. Then I ran back home. An hour later Teddy’s parents showed up. My mom greeted them at the door. ‘Teddy’s been arrested for shoplifting,’ they said’” (Noah 252) </li>
