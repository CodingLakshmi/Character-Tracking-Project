					<li class = "li-default"> “Fufi, I don’t know where her name came from. Panther had a pink nose, so she was Pink Panther and eventually just Panther. They were two sisters who loved and hated each other. They would look out for each other, but they would also fight all the time. Like, blood fights. Biting. Clawing. It was a strange, gruesome relationship.” (Noah 164) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Fufi was beautiful. Clean lines, happy face. She looked like a perfect bull terrier, only skinnier because of the Maltese mixed in.” (Noah 164) </li>

					<li class = "li-default"> “Fufi could do all sorts of tricks. She could jump super high. I mean, Fufi could jump. I could hold a piece of food out above my head and she’d leap up and grab it like it was nothing. If YouTube had been around, Fufi would have been a star” (Noah 166) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Fufi was a little rascal as well… I caught her one day when I was home for the school holidays… Then she went up to this other house and jumped over their wall and into their backyard. What the hell was she doing?... This kid looked at Fufi and called her by some other stupid name, Spotty or some bullshit like that.” (Noah 166-168) </li>

					<li class = "li-default"> “Fufi was dumb as shit. At least we always thought she was dumb as shit. Whenever we called them, Panther would come right away, but Fufi wouldn’t do anything. Panther would run back and get Fufi and then they’d both come. It turned out that Fufi was deaf.” (Noah 165) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Panther was smart enough to stay away, but dumb, lovable Fufi was forever trying to be Abel’s friend. She’d cross his path or be in his way when he’d had a few, and he’d give her the boot. After that she’d go and hide somewhere for a while” (Noah 427) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Fufi getting kicked was always the warning sign that shit was about to go down. The dogs and the workers in the yard often got the first taste of his anger, and that would let the rest of us know to lie low. I’d usually go find Fufi wherever she was hiding and be with her.” (Noah 427) </li>
