					<li class = "li-default"> “Johanna was one of the popular girls. Her best friend was Zaheera. Johanna was beautiful. Zaheera was stunning. Zaheera was colored, Cape Malay. She looked like Salma Hayek. Johanna was out and about and kissing boys, so the guys were all into her. Zaheera, as beautiful as she was, was extremely shy, so there weren’t as many guys after her” (Noah 237) </li>

Still, I got to hang out with them because I knew Johanna and we had this thing from being indifferent schools together” (Noah 237) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “At a certain point I decided to map out a strategy. I decided I’d be best friends with Zaheera and stay friends with her long enough to ask her to the matric dance, what we call our senior prom” (Noah 238) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “I hung out with Zaheera every chance I got. We’d talk about boys, which ones she liked and which ones liked her. I’d give her advice.” (Noah 238) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “At one point she got set up with this guy Gary. They started dating. Gary was in the popular group but kind of shy and Zaheera was in the popular group but kind of shy, so his friends and her friends set them up together, like an arranged marriage. But Zaheera didn’t like Gary at all. She told me. We talked about everything.” (Noah 238-239) </li>

They kissed once, but she didn’t like it, so they never kissed again. Then they broke up for real. I bided my time through it all. I watched Popular Gary go down in flames, and I was still the good friend. ” (Noah 240) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “Then we had the mid-year school holidays. The day we came back, Zaheera wasn’t at school. Then she wasn’t at school the next day. Then she wasn’t at school the day after that.” (Noah 240) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “‘Hey, where’s Zaheera?’ I said. ‘She hasn’t been around for a while. Is she sick?’ ‘No,’ she said. ‘Didn’t anyone tell you? She left the school. She doesn’t go here anymore.’” (Noah 240) </li>
					<li class = "li-default"> “‘What school did she move to?’ I asked. “She didn’t. Her dad got a job in America. During the break, they moved there. They’ve emigrated.’ ‘What?’ ‘Yeah. She’s gone. She was such a good friend, too. I’m really sad. Are you as sad as I am?’ ‘Uh…yeah,” I said, still trying to process everything. ‘I liked Zaheera. She was cool.’” (Noah 241) </li>
